# Mata Kuliah Enterprise Architecture

1. **Session-01: Introduction to Enterprise Architecture**  
   *Assignment*: Identify a problem or opportunity at your workplace where innovative technologies could enhance quality. Use tools such as SWOT analysis if needed.

2. **Session-02: Case Study - Remote Working (or other issues)**  
   *Assignment*: Investigate the vision and mission of your organization. Conduct interviews with board members, managers, colleagues, or other stakeholders. Discuss your ideas with them and document their feedback, which may offer alternative perspectives. Choose one problem as your case study and develop an enterprise architecture for it throughout the semester. Present your findings in the provided paper template and share them with your classmates.

3. **Session-03: TOGAF**  
   *Assignment*: Perform a literature review related to your vision. Collect at least 30 relevant papers, including academic articles, reports, and white papers.

4. **Session-04: Preliminary Phase**  
   *Assignment*: Define the vision you aim to achieve, breaking it down into specific goals or objectives based on the information from the Preliminary phase. Describe both the current state (As-Is) and the desired future state (To-Be) to clarify the vision.

5. **Session-05: Phase A - Architecture Vision**  
   *Assignment*: Create an **As-Is** workflow or business process model influenced by the vision. Develop a **To-Be** workflow or business process model necessary to realize the vision. Identify gaps and outline the actions required to address them.

6. **Session-06: Phase B - Business Architecture**  
   *Assignment*: Develop an **As-Is** data and document model reflecting the vision and current business processes/workflows. Create a **To-Be** data and document model required to achieve the vision, including the updated business processes/workflows. Identify gaps and specify the necessary actions.

7. **Session-07: Phase C - Data Architecture**  
   *Assignment*: Create an **As-Is** applications model impacted by the vision, current business processes/workflows, and existing data and document models. Develop a **To-Be** applications model required to realize the vision, along with the updated data and document models and business processes/workflows. Identify gaps and outline the required actions.

8. **Session-08: Phase D - Application Architecture**  
   *Assignment*: Develop an **As-Is** infrastructure/technology model impacted by the vision, current business processes/workflows, existing data and document models, and applications models. Create a **To-Be** infrastructure/technology model necessary for the vision, incorporating updated business processes/workflows, data and document models, and applications models. Identify gaps and specify the required actions.

9. **Session-09: Phase E - Technology Architecture**  
   *Assignment*: From the actions listed in previous sessions, group them into work packages and estimate the costs (time, labor, and other resources) for execution. Identify opportunities to optimize execution, such as adjusting the order of work packages or merging actions to reduce costs.

10. **Session-10: Phase F - Opportunities and Solutions**  
    *Assignment*: Document all your work and prepare an academic paper (Shinta 2).

11. **Session-11: Phase G - Migration Planning**  
    *Assignment*: Document all your work and prepare an academic paper (Shinta 2).

12. **Session-12: Phase H - Implementation Governance**  
    *Assignment*: Document all your work and prepare an academic paper (Shinta 2).

13. **Session-13: Phase I - Architecture Change Management**  
    *Assignment*: Document all your work and prepare an academic paper (Shinta 2). Convert the paper into English.

14. **Session-14: Requirements Management**
