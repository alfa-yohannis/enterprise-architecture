        \frametitle{Background: WFO vs Remote Working}
        \framesubtitle{\hspace{1cm}}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Covid-19 as the main trigger
            \item Controversy surrounding \textbf{WFO} vs \textbf{Remote Working}
            \item Some are \textbf{pro}, some are \textbf{cons} Remote Working
            \item This problem is still relevant today:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Companies are still implementing \textbf{hybrid working}
                \item \textbf{General issues} such as traffic jams, the environment (pollution, \textit{climate change}), preferences of some workers, etc.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item It is a real-world problem
        \end{enumerate}

        \frametitle{Preliminary Research}
        % \framesubtitle{\hspace{1cm}}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Initial research at MTI Pradita University
            \item Some students' paper assignments
            \item Survey from 91 respondents (target 100 people)
            \item Data is avaiable at: \url{https://zenodo.org/records/8116799}
            \item Could be an illustration of remote working problems
            \item Useful to the basis for implementing \textbf{Enterprise Architecture} in companies to overcome \textbf{remote working} problems
            \item Published paper: \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10327330}

        \frametitle{Result: Benefits of Remote Working}
        \framesubtitle{\hspace{1cm}}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Cost-effective}. Reduce transportation costs for employees. For companies, it saves operational costs.
            \item \textbf{Save time}. The time usually used for commuting is used for other things.
            \item \textbf{Work-life balance}. The remaining time is used for family, hobbies, etc. so you are mentally healthier.
            \item \textbf{More productive}. The remaining time is used to do other tasks. Apart from that, you can choose more time and place so that work results are more optimal and reduce distractions that are usually found in the office.

        \framesubtitle{\hspace{1cm}}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Nature of Work}. Not all jobs can naturally be done remotely, for example factory employees, research in laboratories, etc.
            \item \textbf{Technical issues}. Slow internet connection, technical problems with hardware/software, infrastructure, current applications are inadequate.
            \item \textbf{Requires investment/expenses}. Need funds to purchase data packages, internet connection, hardware/software.
            \item \textbf{Etiquette Issues}. Contacts or assignments outside of working hours, rude emails, etc.
            \item \textbf{Interference from the environment}. Conditions at home are not conducive to work.

        \framesubtitle{\hspace{1cm}}
        \begin{enumerate}

            \item \textbf{Motivational issues}. Employees are not motivated if they are not supervised.
            \item \textbf{Trust issues}. Superiors do not believe that subordinates can work independently.
            \item \textbf{Communication problems}. Problems with communication habits/quality that are different from direct communication.
            \item \textbf{Problems of difficulty socializing, working together}. Difficulty building team work, socializing and networking.

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Increased non-technical abilities, for example etiquette, independence, motivation, communication, confidence
                \item Increasing technical capabilities, for example software usage training for users, IT team for trouble shooting.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Business processes, governance}. Changes to business processes to suit remote working. Performance appraisal rules are based on achievement targets, not based on attendance/working hours.

        \begin{enumerate}
%            \item Most \textbf{Enterprise Architecture} focuses on how IT/IS can support the business and this is characterized by explicit mention of IT/IS components in the framework.
%            \item Then what about other aspects, such as finance, human resources, legal, etc.?
            \item For example: how does \textbf{TOGAF} address the \textbf{financial} aspects of \textbf{Enterprise Architecture}? Are there any disadvantages or advantages? etc.
            \item The \textbf{financial} aspect can be replaced with other aspects of the company, such as HR, legal.
