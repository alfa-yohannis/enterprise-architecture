	\frametitle{Architecture Contract (Part 1)}
	
	The Architecture Contract produced in Phase G is a mutual agreement between development partners and sponsors regarding the outcomes, quality, and viability of the architecture. The success of implementing this contract depends on effective architecture governance. With a governance approach in contract management, the following outcomes can be ensured:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A continuous monitoring system to verify integrity, manage changes, support decision-making, and audit all activities related to architecture within the organization.
		\item Compliance with existing or developing architectural principles, standards, and requirements.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Architecture Contract (Part 2)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Risk identification in all aspects of architecture development and implementation, including internal development per accepted standards, policies, technologies, and products, and operational aspects of the architecture to ensure business continuity in a resilient environment.
		\item A series of processes and practices that ensure accountability, responsibility, and discipline in the development and use of all architectural artifacts.
		\item A formal understanding of the governance organization responsible for the contract, their level of authority, and the scope of architecture under this body's supervision.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{TOGAF Standard and Contract Examples}
	
	The TOGAF standard identifies two examples of contracts:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Architecture Design and Development Contract
		\item Business User Architecture Contract
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

		\item Target Architecture Size
		\item Defined outcome stages
		\item Prioritized joint work plan
		\item Implementation timeline
		\item Architecture delivery and business metrics
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

		\frametitle{Summary}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Implementation Governance defines architecture constraints and obtains signatures on an Architecture Contract.
			\item Deliver the contract and all documentation to the implementation team.
			\item Govern the architecture through implementation with compliance reviews and risk monitoring.
			\item Conduct post-implementation reviews.
